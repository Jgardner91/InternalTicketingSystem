# InternalTicketingSystem
A framework for an internal ticketing system to track projects and contributions

The framework leverages SQL Server on the backend to store tickets. 
The front end leverages SQL alchemy and simple keyboard inputs to edit, create, delete, and insert data into the ticketing log.

Hopefully a GUI will be created in Tkinter for better aesthetics.
