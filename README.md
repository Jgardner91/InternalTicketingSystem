# InternalTicketingSystem
A framework for an internal ticketing system to track projects and contributions

The framework leverages SQL Server and SQL Alchemy on the backend to store, update, create, delete, and insert data into the ticketing log. 
The front end leverages simple keyboard inputs to execute the different methods of the 'Ticket' class.
There is an advatange to using Jupyter Notebook when running the system as it provides a better GUI experience compared 
to using the command line. 

Hopefully a GUI will be created in Tkinter for better aesthetics.
